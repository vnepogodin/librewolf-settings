# LibreWolf settings

LibreWolf settings for all platforms.

we encourage users to find **their own setup** and to use our default configuration as something to build on top of. this is now easier thanks to the [overrides](https://librewolf.net/docs/faq/#where-do-i-find-my-librewolfoverridescfg).

## Useful links
- [website](https://librewolf.net/): read the docs.

- [issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/librewolf-community/settings/-/issues). issues that have the `provide info` label need user input or they will be quarantined after a week, and closed after ten days.

## Notes and thanks
- this repository benefits from the knowledge and research provided by [arkenfox](https://github.com/arkenfox), so special thanks to the project.
we do not use arkenfox's user.js but we try to keep up with it, and we also consider it a great resource for users who want to find their own setup.
- some of the older prefs in this project were taken from [pyllyukko](https://github.com/pyllyukko/user.js/) and many more were investigated on [bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/home);
- thanks to the whole LibreWolf community and to all the contributors of this repo.
